# FlickrApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.2.

## Before running the app

> npm install

# Notes

 - ngx-infinite-scroll library used to handling the scrolling, it offers a simple api that works well.
 - api_key required from a flickr dev account to go in /environments/environments.ts
 - would have liked to add some tests, just ran out of time

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
